# Algorithm for the codeblocks in /codebrocks directory

## Replicando

`,[>+>+<<-]+>>[-<<+>>]<<-` value in first cell is  made to be copied to second and third cell, making the first cell Null. Then making values in first and third  cell interchanged.

## Digix

`,>+++ +++[<++++++++>-]`
Simply taking a digit  and adding 48 to it to print it as a digit rather as its ascii.

## Replicando v2

`,>,-[[->>+<<]<[->+>+<<]>>[-<<+>>]>-[-<+>]<]` first input will get printed second input number of times. Logic here is- copy second input from cell 1 to cell 3. Then copy first input from cell 0 to cell 1 and 2 and then copying cell 2 back to cell 0. Now pointing the pointers accordingly, and repeating this excersise gives you what it gives.
